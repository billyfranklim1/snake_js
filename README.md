# Javascript Snake Game

This is a simple snake game written in Javascript. It uses the HTML5 canvas element to draw the game. The game is written in a way that it can be easily extended to add new features. The repository originally is in video on YouTube (https://youtu.be/J42SZXS-_Qo) but I decided to make some changes and make it available on GitHub.
